### CDM-8 ASM build/run/debug scripts
Before using the main script (`cdm8_asm_brd_script.py`) in NPidE, run `init.py` so it can set up the environment for it. <br/>
After `init.py` is finished, `cdm8config.yml` is created in this directory which can be passed to NPidE as the build/run/debug config file.
